# Agile Process
Jira is used as a project management and bug tracking tool for Bug Resistance web application.
In this project, Agile based scrum development model is followed to build the web application.<br>
### Jira As Agile Project Management Tool
***
<b>Step 1:</b><li> Bug Resistance application requirments are collected and product backlog is designed.</li>

<b>Step 2:</b><li>In Jira, epics and users stories are created from product backlog.</li>
<li>The whole application is divided into 4 epics. They are:</li><ol><li>Home</li><li>Course Admission</li><li>QA Services</li><li>Contact Us</li></ol> 
<li>Each epic is broken down in multiple user stories and each user story is broken down into multiple sub-tasks.</li><li>Some sub-tasks are inter-related or dependent on each other </li><br>

<b>Step 3:</b><li>The whole application is developed into 3 sprints.</li>
<li>Each sprints will have their own sprint backlog including the epics, users stories and sub-tasks under this sprint will be organized before the sprint starts.</li>
<li>Each sprint will last for minimum 1 week to maximum 4 weeks.</li>
<li>Each sprint will result into a released version of the web application.</li><br>

<i><b>Bug Resistance Sprint 1,2,3 have the Jira reports discussed below.</i></b><br>
<b>Sprint Report:</b> This sprint report shows the performance of the team in each sprint. It Shows if the team is overcommiting or excessive scope creep.</b><br>
<b>Burnup Chart:</b> This chart show how much work has been completed in the Bug Resistance project. As there are total 
3 sprints in the whole project, for each sprint there is a burnup chart to show the progress of that sprint. <br>

have their own individual burndown chart.<br>
<b>Velocity Chart:</b> It measures how much work a team can complete in
the given time. It tracks velocity over the 3 sprint.<br>

***
<b>Defect Report:</b> All the defects found in the modules are reported to the team as defect report. The defects should be closed within that sprint or maybe prioritized later for the future sprints.<br>
<br><i>The Bug Life Cycle that is followd in the project is given below:</i><br>
